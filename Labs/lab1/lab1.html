   <p> About yourself, why are you here? What do you want?</p>
    I like painting,  like math, and sweets. I'm a outgoing person once we talk for   an amount of time. I like going out on adventures, traveling, and trying different stuff.I use to play soccer, do ballet, capoeria, and dance class. I have a passion for reading poem books and some novels but just poems usually. I would like to try out more hobbies like i did before. I'm here because somone recommended this class. I want good grades, and to understand computers more. I would also want to go out more and also I want to start taking AP classes but I have to wait till we get any grades in.
