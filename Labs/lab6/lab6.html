<li> What exactly is a favicon?</li>
<i style="color: pink;"> A favicon is the icon which correltaes with the website. It is located on the browser tab to the far left of the titles webpage.</i> 
<p>
<li> How are favicons created?</li>
<i style="color: red;"> Favicons are created by using different websites for examplemcode.org. These websites are used to create a logo which connects with your website/webpage.</i>
<p>
<li> How did I create the favicon for this site?</li>
<i style="color: pink;">I created my favicon using code.org. First we created a paper sketch of how our favicon would look like. Then we practiced by creating a black and white version of our favicon on code.org. Finally, using the knowledge when doing the Black and White version of the favicon, we created a Colored version of our favicon.</i>
<p>
<li> What does your icon look like, in binary and/or hexadecimal?</li>
<i style="color:red;"> My icon is a dash of lines. Almost like a pattern. In binary form it was just black and white, but with hexadecimal it looked a lot better with color.</i>
